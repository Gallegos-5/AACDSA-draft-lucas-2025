# AI Clinical Safety Act (AACDSA)

**A blueprint for safe, auditable, and explainable AI in U.S. healthcare.**

---

## Overview

The **AI Clinical Safety Act (AACDSA)** is a federal legislative proposal to ensure any artificial intelligence (AI) system deployed in U.S. healthcare settings meets rigorous standards for safety, transparency, and accountability. It mandates independent audits, public model cards, explainability protocols, and robust privacy and risk controls for all clinical AI tools used in diagnosis, treatment, or patient care.

## What Does the AACDSA Do?

- **Independent AI Audits:**  
  All clinical AI must undergo third-party safety and bias assessments before use in patient care.

- **Model Cards & Transparency:**  
  Public, standardized disclosures of AI model architecture, training data domains, update history, and limitations.

- **Explainability Requirements:**  
  AI systems must provide human-understandable rationale for clinical decisions and recommendations.

- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Mandatory error, near-miss, and adverse event reporting for AI-enabled workflows; public dashboards for ongoing oversight.

- **Privacy & Security:**  
  Strict compliance with HIPAA, signed firmware and SBOMs for deployed software, and privacy-impact assessments for all AI pilots.

- **Red-Team & Blue-Team Reviews:**  
  Adversarial testing to detect vulnerabilities, data poisoning, or unintended bias before and during clinical deployment.
